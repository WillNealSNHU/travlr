Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

HTML is a corner stone in any front end project. Since the days of updating MySpace pages HTML has been reliable. So it would only make sense to pair it with the dynamic functionality of JavaScript for your normal multipage web applications. SPA’s have shown that they make for an amazing user experience due to their ability to render pages very quickly. MongoDB is an excellent pick for any project looking to scale and have high performance. Even Amazon’s AWS has developed an NoSQL DB for this exact reason. 


Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON files provide data between our web application and the server. Yes JSON stands for JavaScript Object notation, but in reality its functionality is vastly different from JavaScript. JSON is just the text that helps connect the two. 

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

In this project specifically we were using Authorizations to ensure that API data was safe. I also personally added several log.console(element, “message”, and error) throughout the code base so if something breaks it will be easy to see where the problem is. 
Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

I knew nothing about Angular coming into this course. Front end applications have always been a little bit more complicated for me due to a lot of complex layers. I think I made dozens of revisions to my code until I got it to spec. I certainly did a lot of commits with varying functionality. I think my biggest take away from this course is that I can figure out the problem if I continue to put in the time and effort as well as ask for help. At one point I was far behind but I reached out, I said “I don’t understand this”. I used people to “rubber duck”, and while it might have taken me longer than I initially hoped the project was to spec and I learned a lot.
